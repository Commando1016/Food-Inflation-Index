# Food Inflation Index

## Rationale for Choosing the Food Price Inflation Index

Our focus on the food price inflation index rate stems from the current unprecedented surge in food prices. Recognizing this critical issue, we aim to provide valuable insights to policymakers, economists, and stakeholders, facilitating informed decision-making regarding the factors influencing food prices.

## Tools and Methodology

To unravel the complexities behind the escalating food prices, we will employ a diverse array of tools, with a primary emphasis on leveraging Excel, Python, and various Python libraries. Through rigorous analysis, we aim to uncover the underlying drivers contributing to the surge in food prices.

## Vision and Objectives

Our ultimate goal is to develop comprehensive visualizations that depict food inflation trends worldwide. By presenting these visual insights, we aspire to empower policymakers, economists, and stakeholders to discern the underlying factors driving fluctuations in food inflation. These visualizations will serve as a powerful tool for facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning in response to dynamic changes in food prices.

## Consideration of Bias

In our analysis, we place a strong emphasis on mitigating bias in the data. If data was unavailable, it was unfortunately skipped over, but it's important to note that no data has been altered or manipulated in any way.  By maintaining the integrity of the original data and acknowledging any limitations, we ensure transparency and accuracy in our findings, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on reliable information.
